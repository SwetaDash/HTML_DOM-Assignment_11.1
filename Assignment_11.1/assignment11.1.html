   <!--First paragraph--> 
   <p id=para1>The Document Object Model (DOM) is a
        programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the page so that
        programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents
        the document as nodes and objects. That way, programming languages can connect to
        the page.</p>
    <!--Second Paragraph-->    
    <p id=para2>A Web page is a document. This document
        can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source. But it is the same
        document in both cases. The Document Object Model (DOM) represents that same
        document so it can be manipulated. The DOM is an object-oriented representation of
        the web page, which can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.
